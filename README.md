# Data Anlaysis | Streamlit App | Heroku Deployment

This is a data analysis project where I have analyzed the IPL data from season 2008 to 2019 on various aspects.
Used Plotly library for interactive graphs.
Used Streamlit library to create an application to showcase the various analysis done on the data with interactive graphs,images and audio.
Deployed the application on Heroku.
